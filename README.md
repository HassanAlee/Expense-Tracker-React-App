# Expense-Tracker-React-App
This is a complete app that calculates expenses for different things which you add. This is created using React JS.
Functional component are used in this app. useState,usereducer,useEffect,useContext hooks are used.
useState,UseReducer and contextAPI hooks are used to manage state in this app. John Smiliga created the same app using simple useState method but I have tried
to refactor the same application using context api and useReducer. 
useReducer makes state management easy but at the same time it also adds a bit long and systematic way to manage state. This project is a oerfect example for someone who just learned useState and context api and want to practice then.
