# Expense-Tracker-React-App
This is a complete app that calculates expenses for different task which you add. This is created using React JS.
useState,UseReducer and contextAPI hooks are used to manage state in this app. John Smiliga created the same using simple useState method but I have tried
to refactor the same application using context api and useReducer.
